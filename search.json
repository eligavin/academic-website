Amid\nwidespread concerns about the quality of democracy and the risk of\nbacksliding, proponents have argued that compulsory voting would prevent\nthe rise of authoritarian candidates; weaken the forces of partisan\npolarization; and decrease economic inequality. Does compulsory voting\nlive up to such lofty promises in practice?\nMy book project examines popular claims about the implications of\ncompulsory voting, presenting new general-equilibrium theories that\naccount for the strategic interactions between voters and political\nelites under compulsory voting rules. Bringing together causally\nidentified behavioral research with careful study of party strategy, I\nanswer longstanding questions about how compulsory voting shapes the\nbroader political environment. Does compulsory voting lead to a more or\nless partisan electorate? Do the resulting changes in social norms\nproduce a deeper commitment to democratic principles among citizens?\nWill the economic policies implemented under compulsory voting curtail\nrising inequality? As countries begin to have more serious conversations\nabout introducing compulsory voting, the need for answers to these\nquestions has grown more pressing than ever.\nResearch for this project is funded by the Center for the Study of Democratic\nPolitics and the MacMillan\nCenter for International and Area Studies.\nPresidents,\nParties, and the People in Direct Democracy\n(Collaborative work with Radha Sarkar, Shahana Sheikh, and Susan\nStokes)\nIn theory, referendums and other mechanisms of direct democracy help\nrestore a more immediate and participatory dynamic to representative\nsystems, without which political parties, governments, and policy making\ncan appear distant from the common citizen. But in recent years, a\nchorus of voices has grown louder questioning the legitimacy and\neffectiveness of these mechanisms. The Brexit vote and ensuing political\nparalysis in the UK, and the failure of Colombians to approve a\nlong-awaited peace deal, are two events that, in the eyes of many,\nmarred the image of referendums. Critics argue that the results of\nreferendums tend to be volatile and often do not reflect public opinion\non the issue at hand.\nThis book project addresses the value of referendums for democracies.\nWe begin by testing a series of specific propositions about how\nreferendums function, from a positivist perspective. Who participates in\nreferendums and why? When do politicians choose to call referendums\ninstead of pursuing other means of institutional or policy change? Can\ncitizens’ initiatives serve as a check on legislative gerrymandering?\nThe answers to these questions inform a broader normative question: do\nmechanisms of direct democracy outperform representative elections in\naggregating societal preferences? And if so, under what conditions?\nAs part of this project, we are creating a large dataset of every\nnational referendum and plebiscite held in a democracy from 1960 to the\npresent day, including novel measures of key variables such as issue\nsalience and party strategies. This work is part of a broader\ninitiative to create publicly accessible tools for studying and\ntracking democratic functioning and erosion throughout the world. This\nresearch is funded by the United Nations Democracy Fund\n(UNDEF).\n\n\n\n",

But why is this the case? Does voting foster partisanship, as prominent models of political learning and cognitive dissonance postulate? Or does partisanship encourage voting, as expressive voting models and social identity theory suggest? I introduce the concept of partisan duty to capture the role of partisan social identities in the turnout decision, and present new empirical tests of the relationship between partisanship and voting. I leverage a unique institutional arrangement in Chile to establish the direction of causality with a regression discontinuity, and I implement a novel survey design with behavioral outcomes to identify causal mechanisms. Data from the US confirms that the main findings generalize beyond Chile. Electoral participation does not generate partisanship. Instead, partisanship mobilizes voters: it increases the expressive benefits to voting and generates a sense of duty to support one’s partisan group.\n\n2020. “Beyond Opportunity Costs: Campaign Messages, Anger, and Turnout among the Unemployed.” British Journal of Political Science (with S. Erdem Aytaç and Susan Stokes).\nPDF   |   Replication\n\nView Abstract\n\nAre people under economic stress more or less likely to vote, and why? With large observational datasets and a survey experiment involving unemployed Americans, we show that unemployment depresses participation. But it does so more powerfully when the unemployment rate is low, less powerfully when it is high. Whereas earlier studies have explained lower turnout among the unemployed by stressing the especially high opportunity costs these would-be voters face, our evidence points to the psychological effects of unemployment and of campaign messages about it. When unemployment is high, challengers have an incentive to blame the incumbent, thus eliciting anger among the unemployed. Psychologists have shown anger to be an approach or mobilizing emotion. When joblessness is low, campaigns tend to ignore it. The jobless thus remain in states of depression and self-blame, which are demobilizing emotions.\nWorking Papers\n(Available upon request)\n“What Countries Are Most At Risk? Inequality and Democratic Erosion” (with Susan Stokes).\n\n\nView Abstract\n\nNearly two dozen countries have experienced democratic erosion or backsliding in the opening decades of the 21st century. Why are some countries at heightened risk of erosion? Income inequality emerges from our cross-national analyses as a highly robust factor that increases this risk, even in wealthy, longstanding democracies — like the United States. Turning to the mechanisms involved, we identify two effects of inequality, both of which leave voters more tolerant of backsliding leaders. One is partisan polarization, a precursor to erosion; we show that it tends to deepen in unequal countries. The second mechanism we call institutional nihilism, a phenomenon we study with original survey experiments. Nihilists are skeptical that their countries’ institutions are capable of solving public problems and prefer to tear them down. Aspiring autocrats take advantage of — and exacerbate — both polarization and nihilism in order to erode their democracies.\n\n“Why is Participation Low in Referendums? Lessons from Latin America” (with Radha Sarkar and Susan Stokes).\n\n\nView Abstract\n\nWhether referendums, initiatives, and other mechanisms of direct democracy enhance representative systems is a matter of debate. Skeptics note — among other criticisms — that turnout tends to be low in referendums, often lower than in candidate elections in the same country. If citizens don’t care enough to participate, how useful can these mechanisms be for improving the quality of democratic systems? We argue that low referendum turnout has as much to do with parties’ disincentives to mobilize voters as with voter disinterest. Prior research on political behavior in referendums has focused largely on Europe, and assumes that voters view them as elections of lesser importance. By shifting focus to Latin America, we introduce more variation in the features of political parties that influence levels of turnout. We draw on cross-national evidence, qualitative research in Colombia, and quantitative analysis of municipal-level referendum voting behavior in Brazil. The key to understanding low voter turnout in these settings is the relatively weaker incentives that political parties have to turn out the vote when control over office is not at stake. We demonstrate that, in clientelistic systems, party operatives have particularly weak incentives to get their constituents out to the polls.\n\n“Intra-Party Competition in Multi-member Districts: A Formal Model with Evidence from Latin America.”\n\n\nView Abstract\n\nOpen-list proportional representation systems pose a dilemma for parties: often, candidates maximize their electoral prospects by attacking co-partisans and hurting their own party’s prospects. Under what conditions do campaigns devolve into destructive intra-party fighting? The conventional wisdom is that intra-party competition in open-list systems increases as a function of district magnitude. The basic logic is that, when candidates compete on a long list, they must do more to differentiate themselves from their many co-partisans. But in fact, the opposite is true: candidates are most likely to sabotage their co-partisans in the smallest multi-member districts. I clarify the candidate-level incentives for intra-party fighting with a formal model, and test the theory with qualitative and quantitative evidence from Chile and Colombia. In small multi-member districts, the only path to victory for most candidates is to secure the top position on their party lists, often by sabotaging co-partisans. But in larger-magnitude districts, attacking co-partisans quickly becomes a less efficient and riskier strategy.\n\n“Who Trusts the Police in Latin America?” (with Mariela Daby).\n\n\nView Abstract\n\nMainstream narratives suggest that hardly anyone in Latin America trusts the police, with major implications for public policy. We draw on empirical data from ten Latin American countries to examine this claim, and to understand what predicts trust or distrust in the police. We find that citizens express higher levels of trust in the police than they do in many other institutions, but attitudes towards the police are diverse both within and across countries. Experiences with police corruption are among the strongest predictors of trust, at both the individual and national level. The demographics of who trusts the police vary by country, but trust is generally lower among those who are young, male, living in urban areas, and indigenous — all populations that are especially likely to suffer abuse at the hands of police. Notably, however, wealth and higher education are also correlated with distrust in the police. \n\n“ ‘People Like Me’: A Group-Identity Model of Voter Turnout.”\n\n\nView Abstract\n\nI present a novel model of voter turnout that formalizes a key intuition about the rationality of voter turnout: a crucial determining factor in political participation is the sense of belonging to a group. Models of voter turnout often focus exclusively on individuals; yet many voters conceive of their participation in terms of groups. I construct a Kantian model that incorporates group-level logic without requiring altruistic voters — voters in the Kantian model consider the behavior of voters with similar preferences when selecting their strategy; but their end goal is to maximize their own personal utility. The model also provides a framework for modeling endogenous social norms that respond to the particular circumstances of each election.\n\nPapers In Progress\n“Tit-for-Tat and Public Perceptions of Anti-Democratic Behavior” (with Noam Lupu and Elizabeth Zechmeister).\n“Measuring Gender in Latin American Surveys” (with Noam Lupu, Valerie Schweizer-Robinson, and Elizabeth Zechmeister).\n“Compulsory for Whom?
