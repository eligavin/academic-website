Amid\nwidespread concerns about the quality of democracy and the risk of\nbacksliding, proponents have argued that compulsory voting would prevent\nthe rise of authoritarian candidates; weaken the forces of partisan\npolarization; and decrease economic inequality. Does compulsory voting\nlive up to such lofty promises in practice?\nMy book project examines popular claims about the implications of\ncompulsory voting, presenting new general-equilibrium theories that\naccount for the strategic interactions between voters and political\nelites under compulsory voting rules. Bringing together causally\nidentified behavioral research with careful study of party strategy, I\nanswer longstanding questions about how compulsory voting shapes the\nbroader political environment. Does compulsory voting lead to a more or\nless partisan electorate? Do the resulting changes in social norms\nproduce a deeper commitment to democratic principles among citizens?\nWill the economic policies implemented under compulsory voting curtail\nrising inequality? As countries begin to have more serious conversations\nabout introducing compulsory voting, the need for answers to these\nquestions has grown more pressing than ever.\nResearch for this project is funded by the Center for the Study of Democratic\nPolitics and the MacMillan\nCenter for International and Area Studies.\nPresidents,\nParties, and the People in Direct Democracy\n(Collaborative work with Radha Sarkar, Shahana Sheikh, and Susan\nStokes)\nIn theory, referendums and other mechanisms of direct democracy help\nrestore a more immediate and participatory dynamic to representative\nsystems, without which political parties, governments, and policy making\ncan appear distant from the common citizen. But in recent years, a\nchorus of voices has grown louder questioning the legitimacy and\neffectiveness of these mechanisms. The Brexit vote and ensuing political\nparalysis in the UK, and the failure of Colombians to approve a\nlong-awaited peace deal, are two events that, in the eyes of many,\nmarred the image of referendums. Critics argue that the results of\nreferendums tend to be volatile and often do not reflect public opinion\non the issue at hand.\nThis book project addresses the value of referendums for democracies.\nWe begin by testing a series of specific propositions about how\nreferendums function, from a positivist perspective. Who participates in\nreferendums and why? When do politicians choose to call referendums\ninstead of pursuing other means of institutional or policy change? Can\ncitizens’ initiatives can serve as a check on legislative\ngerrymandering? The answers to these questions inform a broader\nnormative question: do mechanisms of direct democracy outperform\nrepresentative elections in aggregating societal preferences? And if so,\nunder what conditions?\nAs part of this project, we are creating a large dataset of every\nnational referendum and plebiscite held in a democracy from 1960 to the\npresent day, including novel measures of key variables such as issue\nsalience and party strategies. This work is part of a broader\ninitiative to create publicly accessible tools for studying and\ntracking democratic functioning and erosion throughout the world. This\nresearch is funded by the United Nations Democracy Fund\n(UNDEF).\n\n\n\n",

But why is this the\ncase? Does voting foster partisanship, as prominent models of political\nlearning and cognitive dissonance postulate? Or does partisanship\nencourage voting, as expressive voting models and social identity theory\nsuggest? I introduce the concept of partisan duty to capture the role of\npartisan social identities in the turnout decision, and present new\nempirical tests of the relationship between partisanship and voting. I\nleverage a unique institutional arrangement in Chile to establish the\ndirection of causality with a regression discontinuity, and I implement\na novel survey design with behavioral outcomes to identify causal\nmechanisms. Data from the US confirms that the main findings generalize\nbeyond Chile. Electoral participation does not generate partisanship.\nInstead, partisanship mobilizes voters: it increases the expressive\nbenefits to voting and generates a sense of duty to support one’s\npartisan group.\n\n2020. “Beyond\nOpportunity Costs: Campaign Messages, Anger, and Turnout among the\nUnemployed.” British Journal of Political Science (with S.\nErdem Aytaç and Susan Stokes).\nPDF   |   Replication\n\nView Abstract\n\nAre people under economic stress more or less likely to vote, and why?\nWith large observational datasets and a survey experiment involving\nunemployed Americans, we show that unemployment depresses participation.\nBut it does so more powerfully when the unemployment rate is low, less\npowerfully when it is high. Whereas earlier studies have explained lower\nturnout among the unemployed by stressing the especially high\nopportunity costs these would-be voters face, our evidence points to the\npsychological effects of unemployment and of campaign messages about it.\nWhen unemployment is high, challengers have an incentive to blame the\nincumbent, thus eliciting anger among the unemployed. Psychologists have\nshown anger to be an approach or mobilizing emotion. When joblessness is\nlow, campaigns tend to ignore it. The jobless thus remain in states of\ndepression and self-blame, which are demobilizing emotions.\nWorking Papers\n(Drafts available upon request)\n“Parties and Mobilization in Referendums” (with Radha Sarkar and\nSusan Stokes).\n“‘People Like Me’: A Group-Identity Model of Voter Turnout.”\n“Intra-Party Competition in Multi-member Districts: A Formal Model\nwith Evidence from Latin America.”\nPapers In Progress\n“Social Media and Participation in High-Risk Activism” (with Mariela\nDaby)\n“Why Do Countries Legalize Same-Sex Marriage But Not Abortion?\nEvidence from Latin America” (with Mariela Daby)\n“Does Mandatory Voting Make People Partisan?
