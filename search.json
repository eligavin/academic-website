Amid widespread concerns about the quality of democracy and the risk of backsliding, proponents have argued that compulsory voting would prevent the rise of authoritarian candidates; weaken the forces of partisan polarization; and decrease economic inequality. Does compulsory voting live up to such lofty promises in practice?\nMy book project examines popular claims about the implications of compulsory voting, presenting new general-equilibrium theories that account for the strategic interactions between voters and political elites under compulsory voting rules. Bringing together causally identified behavioral research with careful study of party strategy, I answer longstanding questions about how compulsory voting shapes the broader political environment. Does compulsory voting lead to a more or less partisan electorate? Do the resulting changes in social norms produce a deeper commitment to democratic principles among citizens? Will the economic policies implemented under compulsory voting curtail rising inequality? As countries begin to have more serious conversations about introducing compulsory voting, the need for answers to these questions has grown more pressing than ever.\nResearch for this project is funded by the Center for the Study of Democratic Politics and the MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies.\nAre Referendums Democratic?\n(Collaborative work with Radha Sarkar, Shahana Sheikh, and Susan Stokes)\nIn theory, referendums and other mechanisms of direct democracy help restore a more immediate and participatory dynamic to representative systems, without which political parties, governments, and policy making can appear distant from the common citizen. But in recent years, a chorus of voices has grown louder questioning the legitimacy and effectiveness of these mechanisms. The Brexit vote and ensuing political paralysis in the UK, and the failure of Colombians to approve a long-awaited peace deal, are two events that, in the eyes of many, marred the image of referendums. Critics argue that the results of referendums tend to be volatile and often do not reflect public opinion on the issue at hand.\nThis book project addresses the value of referendums for democracies. We begin by testing a series of specific propositions about how referendums function, from a positivist perspective. Who participates in referendums and why? When do politicians choose to call referendums instead of pursuing other means of institutional or policy change? Can citizens’ initiatives can serve as a check on legislative gerrymandering? The answers to these questions inform a broader normative question: do mechanisms of direct democracy outperform representative elections in aggregating societal preferences? And if so, under what conditions?\nAs part of this project, we are creating a large dataset of every national referendum and plebiscite held in a democracy from 1960 to the present day, including novel measures of key variables such as issue salience and party strategies. This work is part of a broader initiative to create publicly accessible tools for studying and tracking democratic functioning and erosion throughout the world. This research is funded by the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF).\n\n\n\n",

But why is this the case? Does voting foster partisanship, as prominent models of political learning and cognitive dissonance postulate? Or does partisanship encourage voting, as expressive voting models and social identity theory suggest? I introduce the concept of partisan duty to capture the role of partisan social identities in the turnout decision, and present new empirical tests of the relationship between partisanship and voting. I leverage a unique institutional arrangement in Chile to establish the direction of causality with a regression discontinuity, and I implement a novel survey design with behavioral outcomes to identify causal mechanisms. Data from the US confirms that the main findings generalize beyond Chile. Electoral participation does not generate partisanship. Instead, partisanship mobilizes voters: it increases the expressive benefits to voting and generates a sense of duty to support one’s partisan group.\n\n2020. “Beyond Opportunity Costs: Campaign Messages, Anger, and Turnout among the Unemployed.” British Journal of Political Science (with S. Erdem Aytaç and Susan Stokes).\nPDF   |   Replication\nView Abstract Are people under economic stress more or less likely to vote, and why? With large observational datasets and a survey experiment involving unemployed Americans, we show that unemployment depresses participation. But it does so more powerfully when the unemployment rate is low, less powerfully when it is high. Whereas earlier studies have explained lower turnout among the unemployed by stressing the especially high opportunity costs these would-be voters face, our evidence points to the psychological effects of unemployment and of campaign messages about it. When unemployment is high, challengers have an incentive to blame the incumbent, thus eliciting anger among the unemployed. Psychologists have shown anger to be an approach or mobilizing emotion. When joblessness is low, campaigns tend to ignore it. The jobless thus remain in states of depression and self-blame, which are demobilizing emotions.\nWorking Papers\n(Drafts available upon request)\n“Parties and Mobilization in Referendums” (with Radha Sarkar and Susan Stokes).\n“Intra-Party Competition in Multi-member Districts: A Formal Model with Evidence from Latin America.”\nPapers In Progress\n“Why Do Countries Legalize Same-Sex Marriage But Not Abortion?
